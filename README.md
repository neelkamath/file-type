# file_type

Checks the type(s) of a file. For example, `.circleci.yml` is either `.yml`, or `.circleci.yml`.

This project has been deprecated because it makes no sense adding a dependency for such a small "feature" (the `String.endswith` function accomplishes roughly the same things as this package does).
